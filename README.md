# Android-App-For-Tour-Guides

Due to the large number of labs on campus and even larger number of things of interest within them, it is difficult for tour guides to remember information about each and take tour takers inside each for a closer look. An android app was developed to help in this regard. The app scans QR codes outside labs, pulls relevant information from a database, and shows a list of items in that lab. Each of these can be clicked to see pictures, YouTube videos and descriptions which can also be emailed to interested tour takers right away. This app has the potential of not only enhancing the tour experience but also reducing training time for new tour guides.
